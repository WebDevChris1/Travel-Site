# Travel-Site

In this project I have created a basic travel info site demonstrating my knowledge for flexbox. I made this project before learning about CSS Grid so it was an in debth learning experience. Overall by the end of this project I had a solid understanding of flexbox basics. I have also learned basic animation tricks to make the site a bit more fancy
